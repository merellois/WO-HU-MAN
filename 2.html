    WO/HU/MAN is a movement that stands for changing the perspective of toxic masculinity.
    With this movement we try to show the importance of equality. We all are human and need to stop putting people in boxes that they can not escape from. Toxic masculinity is upholding a delusional “reality” on how to be a man. Our goal is to show that it is not important how to be a manly man, but how to be human.
